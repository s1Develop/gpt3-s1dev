Here is a webpage for my first React project.

# My first website project was a great learning experience. I completed the hosting of my webpage and finished the project using React by following an online video tutorial. Throughout the process, I learned about the reusability of React functional components and the React file and folder structure. I also mastered fundamental CSS properties such as flex and grid, as well as the fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model. I added soft and pleasant animations to my website, along with complex gradients. I made sure to include perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness, covering almost all devices. At the end of the project, I learned how to deploy my website through Hostinger.
