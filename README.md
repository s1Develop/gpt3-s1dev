## Here is a webpage for my first React project.

### My first website project was a great learning experience. I completed the hosting of my webpage and finished the project using React by following an online video tutorial. Throughout the process, I learned following skills,
### - The reusability of React functional components and the React file and folder structure. 
### - mastered fundamental CSS properties such as flex and grid, as well as the fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model. 
### - I added soft and pleasant animations to my website, along with complex gradients. 
### - I made sure to include perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness, covering almost all devices. 
### - At the end of the project, I learned how to deploy my website through Hostinger. However, I also discovered that I could host my own website using GitHub Pages. So, I used GitHub Pages instead.
